Hello!

As you have probably read before, I am trying to code the financial concepts taught in the Options Volatility and Pricing book. I say "I am trying" because even though I come from a sciences background (engineering graduated) I do not know a lot about Python coding or quantitative finances. But I will do my best and learn it by doing it, be assured.

I always welcome suggestions and tips for improving my coding or my understanding about the underlying financial concepts being applied.

Thank you for your time and I hope you find this useful.

SSV.
